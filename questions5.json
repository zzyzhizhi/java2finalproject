Maybe someone, who is an expert  at Java developement sees the issue instantly, but for me it remains a mysterie.</p>\n<p>I have here an screenshot of the code from the video, my code of course and the link to the video.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/VqXDt.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Image of code from Video</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMeck_nTdVA&amp;t=7s\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">link to video</a></p>\n<p>[my code]</p>\n<pre><code>@EventHandler\n    public void toggle (PlayerInteractEvent event) {\n        final Player player = event.getPlayer();\n        if(event.getAction() == Action.LEFT_CLICK_AIR) {\n            new BukkitRunnable() {\n                Location loc  = player.getLocation();\n                double t = 0;\n                double r = 1;\n                public void run() {\n                    t = t + Math.PI / 8;\n                    double x = r * cos(t);\n                    double y = t;\n                    double z = r * sin(t);\n                    loc.add(x , y , z);\n                    ParticleEffect.FLAME.display(loc , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1);\n                    loc.subtract(x , y , z);\n                if(t &gt; Math.PI * 4) {\n                    this.cancel();\n                }\n                }\n\n            }.runTaskTimer(ParticleTest.getInstance , 0 , 1);\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p>The Problem is, that is all the code I got. And that is also all he shows in the video, so I can't give more code for you to replicate this. How I did it, I just wrote and @Eventhandler in the main Class Wich is automatically created when you create a new project. So I have an OnEnable Funktion wich is empty and an OnDisable Function Wich is also empty above the shown code.</p>\n<p>I think for u to understand it might help to watch some of the video to understand the problem I have. There's not more than what I have with anything working.</p>\n<p>If you type this code in the writing Programm, 2 things won't work. First the Statement &quot;ParticleEffect.FLAME.display&quot;\nIf I only use &quot;Particle.FlAME&quot; here, the display doesn't work.\nSecond thing, the &quot;.runtasktimer(ParticleTest.getInstance[...])&quot; doesn't work, because apparently something like &quot;.getInstance&quot; doesn't exist.</p>\n<p>Ive tried to copy the code to learn and understand and then modify the code. But the code didnt worked in the first place, so I did not achieve any of this.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","hibernate","spring-data-jpa"],"owner":{"account_id":28553644,"reputation":19,"user_id":21858148,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/707d0034ab5678bad0248043e3faea4a?s=256&d=identicon&r=PG&f=y&so-version=2","display_name":"Rob","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/21858148/rob"},"comment_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":18,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1685256619,"creation_date":1685256619,"question_id":76350288,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76350288/exception-sending-context-initialized-event-to-listener-instance-of-class-while","title":"Exception

However, it means that the thread will eventually be blocked, so, as we are still on the old-fashioned threading model, we'll actually block the <em>platform</em> thread, which is still not really efficient way of dealing with CPU resources.</p>\n<h1>Here is the question:</h1>\n<p>So, the question is, could we use the <em>virtual</em> threads with reactive frameworks directly for making blocking calls like this, using, for example, <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/19/docs/api/java.base/java/util/concurrent/Executors.html#newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor()\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor()</a> :</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Creates an Executor that starts a new virtual Thread for each task.\nThe number of threads created by the Executor is unbounded.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<pre><code>Mono.fromCallable(() -&gt; {\n    return blockingOperation();\n}).subscribeOn(Schedulers.fromExecutorService(Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor()));\n</code></pre>\n<p>Would it work out of the box? Will we actually get the benefits from this approach, in terms of dealing with our CPU-resources more efficiently and increase performance of our application? Does it mean that we can easily integrate reactive library with any blocking library/framework, for example, Spring Data JPA (which is based on JDBC) and millions of others and magically turn them to non-blocking?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","spring-data-jpa"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":2669818,"reputation":700,"user_id":2307460,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":60,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/121Xe.jpg?s=256&g=1","display_name":"Yogesh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2307460/yogesh"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1685159298,"post_id":76344835,"comment_id":134626255,"content_license":"CC

I do not wish to change the HTTP library I am using but rather I'd like to extend it.</p>\n\n<p>To that end, <strong>how do I implement a <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ThreadPoolExecutor.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">ThreadPoolExecutor</a> with the following constraints?</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The executor has an optional rate limit.</li>\n<li>When the rate-limit is disabled, it executes tasks as quickly as possible (normal behavior for a <code>ThreadPoolExecutor</code>).</li>\n<li>When the rate-limit is enabled, it may execute up to <code>N</code> tasks per second.</li>\n<li>The rate-limit applies across all executor threads, not per-thread.</li>\n<li>No bursts are allowed. Meaning, if the limit is 10 requests per second I expect one request to begin every 100ms. I don't want all threads firing at once then remaining idle for the rest of the second.</li>\n<li>The rate-limit is dynamic. If a request fails, the rate decreases. If a request succeeds, the rate increases.</li>\n<li>Threads are considered idle when no tasks are ready for execution (taking the rate limit into consideration). Meaning, I expect <code>ThreadPoolExecutor</code> to flag these threads are idle and spin them down as it sees fit as opposed to blocking the threads until the rate-limit is met. On the flip side, threads should spin up again once it's time to execute the next task.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>What I've Looked Into</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a

href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/DelayQueue.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">DelayedQueue</a> assume that the execution delay is known at event-queuing time, whereas in my case the rate may change between the time a task is queued and the time it is executed.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://google.github.io/guava/releases/snapshot-jre/api/docs/com/google/common/util/concurrent/RateLimiter.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">RateLimiter</a> will probably form part of the answer but is

Now, suppose I want <code>ObjectMapper</code> autowired. I annotate both the top-level class and the <code>Builder</code> as <code>@Component</code>s. Then if I call <code>build()</code>, <code>ObjectMapper</code> isn't going to be injected, is it?, since the top-level class instance is going to be created with a simple constructor call, it's not coming from the Spring container, is it? <strong>Can I have a builder like that while also autowiring dependencies?</strong> While in this case I can simply initialize the <code>ObjectMapper</code> field with a no-args constructor (hoping it's going to be the same <code>ObjectMapper</code> as the autowired one), it may make sense for &quot;expectation testers&quot; that use an <code>EntityManager</code></p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>// most fields are omitted for brevity\n@Component\npublic class GetCommentExpectationTester implements ExpectationTester {\n    @PersistenceContext\n    private EntityManager entityManager;\n    @Override\n    public void test() {\n        assertTrue(entityManager.createQuery(&quot;&quot;&quot;\n                SELECT COUNT(qc.id) = 1\n                FROM QuestionComment qc\n                JOIN qc.owner ow\n                JOIN qc.question q\n                WHERE qc.createdDate IS NOT NULL\n                AND qc.modifiedDate IS NOT NULL\n                AND qc.text = 'text'\n                AND ow.id = 1\n                AND q.id = 1\n                &quot;&quot;&quot;, Boolean.class)\n                .getSingleResult());\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p>I can autowire a field, an <code>ObjectMapper</code> or an <code>EntityManager</code> for example, at the <code>Builder</code> level. But then I won't be able to create a <code>Builder</code> instance and pass a response right in a test method like that, will I?</p>\n<p>I can also simply pass the autowired <code>EntityManager</code> as a method argument (the test class has one) when creating a <code>Builder</code> instance. But since reading Robert Martin's books, I am super-wary of passing anything. The less you pass, the better, that's my takeaway</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","htmlunit","htmlunit-driver"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":23740623,"reputation":886,"user_id":17758716,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f48a836b0f4f00d926ea4d76a51aa851?s=256&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Reilas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/17758716/reilas"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1685203827,"post_id":76347317,"comment_id":134630403,"content_license":"CC
